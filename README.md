# opinion-mining using Ontology
## The ideology of the web has altered and many changes took place in this so called Internet called social web. Each and every user is aware of technologies and the social web, people are totally sticking in online using internet and now-a-days shopping is done on online websites where the orders come home without risk, When ordering online by seeing images is difficult so, there are reviews where the customers give the rating when a product is bought under that product. People are more interested in rating and reviews than believing the pictures where opinion ming comes into the picture. In opinion mining, the unorganized data is organized and put it in a good order and find polarity so that customers feel easy shopping, but in opinion mining there are missing semantic relations and less features extraction so as we get into the ontology which helps to get more hidden aspects and features with the semantic relations in an order.
